Development Standards
- Back Standards
    - Back types as a single module accepting height and width parameters
- Positioning Standards
    - Model starts at X 0 and goes positive
    - Back starts at X 0 and goes negative
- Testing Critiera
    - Compiles without error
    - Test items under 5mm in height, depth, and width and verify back generates properly
